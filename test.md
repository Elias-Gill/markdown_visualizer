*One large paragraph without wrap (this should be italic):*

Contrary to popular **belief**, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, *consectetur*, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of *De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum* (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

This is a larger paragraph but with soft breaks: The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum
used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 
and 1.10.33 from *De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum* by Cicero are also reproduced
in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
translation by H. Rackham.

This does not have to be, but what’s next to it **is STRONG WITH COLOR**. This should be glued: Things unrelated
`something but with inline code`

## Latin characters test

The boy asked for coffee with sugar and a small portion of cold pineapple, while
watching the sun set behind the mountains. "What day is it today?",
he asked curiously, not noticing the clock was already quarter past eight.
In the distance, a song said: What a joy to come home after so long! — and at that instant — everything seemed to stop: the air, the light, and even the murmur of the river.

1. Spanish: ¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás? Ñandu atí.
2. French: Bonjour! Ça va?
3. German: Grüß Gott!
